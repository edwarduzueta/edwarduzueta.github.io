I’ve always been interested in technology and problem-solving, but what drives me most is finding a way to connect those skills to service. Right now, I’m working toward my **B.A. in Information and Computer Science at UH Mānoa** while also serving in the **Army National Guard as a 35N Signals Intelligence Analyst** and participating in **ROTC**.  

My long-term goal is to build a career in the military, ideally in the field of **intelligence**. I want to take the training, discipline, and technical skills I’ve gained so far and apply them to missions that matter. Holding a **TS/SCI clearance with CI polygraph** already puts me in a strong position to pursue roles that combine national defense with advanced technology.  

On the academic side, I want to keep pushing myself deeper into **computer science**—areas like cybersecurity, data analysis, and software engineering. These fields are not only critical to the military, but also to the larger world. By the time I graduate in 2027, I plan to be well prepared to step into roles that blend leadership, coding, and intelligence work.  

In the end, my goal is simple: I want to use my skills and experience to protect, serve, and lead—whether that’s in uniform or through technology-driven intelligence work. This isn’t just a career path for me, it’s the way I want to build my life.
