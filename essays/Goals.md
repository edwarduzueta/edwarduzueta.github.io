I have always been fascinated by technology and problem solving, but what truly drives me is the idea of putting those skills toward something bigger than myself. Right now, I am pursuing my **B.A. in Information and Computer Science at UH MƒÅnoa** while serving in the **Army National Guard as a 35N Signals Intelligence Analyst** and training as part of **ROTC**. Each of these roles challenges me in different ways, but together they have taught me discipline, resilience, and how to balance responsibility with growth.  

My long-term goal is to build a career in the military, specifically in the field of **intelligence**. I want to take the training and technical knowledge I have gained and apply it to missions that make a real difference. Serving as a signals intelligence analyst has already shown me how critical this work is, and I know that holding a **TS/SCI clearance with CI polygraph** gives me the chance to pursue opportunities where I can contribute at the highest levels of trust and responsibility.  

Academically, I want to push myself further into **computer science**, especially in areas like cybersecurity, data analysis, and software engineering. These fields are shaping the future of both the military and the civilian world, and I want to be prepared to stand at the intersection of leadership and technology. By the time I graduate in 2027, I plan to have the skills, mindset, and experience to step into roles where coding, strategy, and service come together.  

For me, this path is not just about a career. It is about living a life of service, using what I have learned to protect and lead, whether in uniform or through technology-driven intelligence work. My goal is simple but meaningful: to take every skill, every challenge, and every lesson I have faced so far and use them to build a life dedicated to something greater than myself.  

Looking forward, I also want to combine my training in computer science with my Army National Guard service to support intelligence missions more directly. I see myself contributing not only through my role as a signals intelligence analyst, but also by building technical tools and solutions that help analysts and decision makers work more effectively. This combination of service and technology is where I believe I can make the biggest impact.
