## I. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence has become a normal part of learning in computer science, especially in courses that focus on real tools and workflows. In software engineering, the challenge is not just knowing concepts, but being able to debug errors, follow standards, understand frameworks, and keep moving when something breaks. In ICS 314, where the course structure emphasizes discipline, repetition, and consistency, AI became part of how I handled obstacles rather than something that replaced learning.

Throughout the course, I used ChatGPT at a moderate level. I did not rely heavily on other AI tools like Bard or GitHub Copilot. Most of my AI usage focused on debugging errors, understanding ESLint and coding standards, checking assumptions, and improving the structure and clarity of my writing. Used this way, AI helped support my learning by explaining problems and reinforcing concepts instead of simply giving answers.

## II. Personal Experience with AI

Below, I describe how I used AI across different parts of ICS 314, including where it helped and where it had limitations.

### 1. Experience WODs (TypeScript, Coding Standards, UI Design, Next.js)

I used AI during many of the Experience WODs, especially for TypeScript, coding standards, UI design, and Next.js. These WODs were often strict and time-boxed, and getting stuck early could make it difficult to finish. AI helped when I ran into confusing compiler errors or linting issues that were not obvious from the error message alone. By explaining what the error meant and why it existed, AI helped me decide what to fix first instead of guessing randomly. However, I still had to apply the fixes myself and ensure they followed the WOD constraints.

### 2. In-class Practice WODs

For in-class practice WODs, I mostly used AI after completing the task. These WODs were meant for learning rather than performance, so reviewing mistakes mattered more than speed. AI helped me understand why certain solutions were discouraged and how small changes could improve readability or structure. This was especially useful for coding standards and UI-related practice, where consistency mattered more than functionality alone. Using AI this way made practice WODs more valuable as learning tools.

### 3. In-class WODs

I used AI much less during in-class WODs because of the pace and pressure. These felt more like checks on preparation and problem-solving ability, and stopping to consult AI often slowed me down. In most cases, rereading the instructions carefully or relying on muscle memory from practice was more effective. Avoiding AI here helped me build confidence in my own ability to perform under time constraints.

### 4. Essays

When working on essays, I used AI mainly for outlining and grammar cleanup. I always wrote the ideas and reflections myself, then used AI to improve organization, clarity, and formatting for my GitHub portfolio. This helped me focus on content instead of getting stuck rewriting sentences or fixing structure. AI made the writing process smoother without changing the meaning of what I wanted to say.

### 5. Final Project

During the final project, AI was most useful for debugging and understanding error messages. When something broke and the error output was unclear, AI helped explain what the message meant and what parts of the code or configuration were worth checking. AI did not design or build the project for me, but it reduced the time I spent stuck, which allowed me to focus on improving functionality and structure instead of fighting errors.

### 6. Learning a Concept or Tutorial

AI helped me learn concepts related to ESLint rules and coding standards more effectively. When I did not understand why a rule existed or why something was considered bad practice, AI explained the reasoning in simpler terms. This helped me apply standards more consistently instead of just fixing warnings without understanding them. Over time, this improved my overall code quality.

### 7. Answering a Question in Class or Discord

Sometimes I used AI privately to double-check my understanding before answering questions in class or on Discord. This helped me avoid spreading incorrect information and made me more confident when participating. AI acted as a quick verification tool, especially when I understood the idea but was unsure about details.

### 8. Asking or Answering a Smart Question

AI helped me turn vague confusion into clearer questions. By rephrasing what I was stuck on and adding context about what I had already tried, I was able to ask better questions. This usually resulted in faster and more helpful responses from classmates or instructors. Over time, this also helped me improve how I communicate technical problems on my own.

### 9. Coding Examples

When I needed a quick reminder of syntax or structure, I sometimes used AI for small coding examples. These examples helped refresh my memory without forcing me to dig through documentation for simple cases. I treated them as references rather than solutions and adapted them to fit my own code and the course requirements.

### 10. Explaining Code

AI was useful for explaining code, especially when revisiting older files or unfamiliar patterns. Having a step-by-step explanation helped me understand what the code was doing and why it behaved a certain way. This made it easier to modify or extend the code later without breaking it.

### 11. Writing Code

I avoided directly copying large chunks of AI-generated code. When I did look at examples, I rewrote them myself to make sure I understood how they worked and how they fit into my project. This approach helped prevent AI from becoming a crutch while still allowing me to learn from examples.

### 12. Documenting Code

AI helped improve my documentation by suggesting clearer descriptions for functions and components. This made my code easier to understand for others and for my future self. I still verified that the documentation accurately reflected the behavior of the code, since documentation is only useful if it is correct.

### 13. Quality Assurance

One of the most useful applications of AI in ICS 314 was quality assurance. AI helped explain ESLint warnings and suggest fixes, which made it easier to recognize recurring mistakes. Over time, this improved my ability to write cleaner code without relying as heavily on linting feedback.

### 14. Other Uses in ICS 314

AI also helped with planning by breaking larger assignments into smaller steps. This made projects feel more manageable and reduced the feeling of being overwhelmed. Using AI for planning helped me stay organized and approach assignments more systematically.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

Using AI in ICS 314 helped me learn more efficiently when used intentionally. It made debugging faster and reinforced concepts like coding standards and structured problem solving. At the same time, I learned that relying too much on AI can limit growth if I skip the thinking process. The most effective approach was trying first and using AI only when I was genuinely stuck.

## IV. Practical Applications Outside ICS 314

Outside of ICS 314, I have used AI for debugging in other courses, understanding documentation, and improving resumes. These experiences showed that AI fits naturally into real-world software workflows when used carefully and responsibly.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities

The main challenge with AI was accuracy. Sometimes it gave confident but incorrect suggestions, which required verification. However, this also created an opportunity to practice evaluating information critically, which is an important skill in software engineering.

## VI. Comparative Analysis

Traditional teaching methods in ICS 314 emphasized discipline and repetition, while AI-enhanced learning improved efficiency and understanding. Combining both approaches led to the strongest learning outcomes, as AI supported learning without replacing effort.

## VII. Future Considerations

AI will likely continue to be part of software engineering education. Teaching students how to use it responsibly, verify results, and avoid overreliance will be increasingly important as these tools become more common.

## VIII. Conclusion

My experience with AI in ICS 314 showed that AI is most effective when used as a support tool rather than a shortcut. It helped me debug issues, understand standards, and stay productive without replacing learning. When paired with discipline and personal responsibility, AI can enhance software engineering education in a meaningful and realistic way.
