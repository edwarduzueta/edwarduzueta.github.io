## I. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence has become a normal part of learning in computer science, especially in courses that emphasize real tools, workflows, and professional habits. In software engineering, the challenge is not just knowing concepts, but being able to debug errors, follow coding standards, understand frameworks, and continue making progress when things break. In ICS 314, where discipline, repetition, and consistency are core themes, AI became part of how I handled obstacles rather than something that replaced the learning process.

Throughout the course, I used ChatGPT at a moderate level. I did not rely heavily on other AI tools like Bard or GitHub Copilot. Most of my AI usage focused on debugging errors, understanding ESLint and coding standards, checking assumptions, and improving the structure and clarity of my writing. Used this way, AI supported my learning by reinforcing concepts and explaining problems instead of simply generating answers.

## II. Personal Experience with AI

Below, I describe how I used AI across different parts of ICS 314, including where it helped, where it did not, and what tradeoffs I noticed.

### 1. Experience WODs (TypeScript, Coding Standards, UI Design, Next.js)

I used AI during many Experience WODs, particularly those involving TypeScript, coding standards, UI design, and Next.js. These WODs were strict and time-boxed, so getting stuck early could make it difficult to complete them successfully. AI helped when I encountered confusing compiler errors or ESLint warnings that were not obvious from the error messages alone. By explaining what the error meant and why it occurred, AI helped me decide what to fix first instead of guessing. However, I still had to apply all fixes myself and ensure they followed the exact WOD constraints, which required careful review.

### 2. In-class Practice WODs

For in-class practice WODs, I typically used AI after completing the exercise rather than during it. These WODs were designed for learning and reinforcement, so reviewing mistakes was more important than finishing quickly. AI helped me understand why certain solutions were discouraged and why specific patterns were preferred. This was especially helpful for coding standards and UI design, where small structural choices mattered. Using AI this way made the practice WODs more educational rather than just another task to complete.

### 3. In-class WODs

I used AI much less during in-class WODs because of the pace and pressure. These WODs felt more like performance checks, where stopping to consult AI often slowed me down more than it helped. In most cases, rereading the instructions carefully or relying on repetition from previous practice was more effective. Avoiding AI in these situations forced me to trust my preparation and problem-solving ability. This helped build confidence in my ability to perform under time constraints without external assistance.

### 4. Essays

When writing essays, I used AI mainly for outlining and grammar cleanup. I always wrote the ideas and reflections myself before involving AI. After drafting, I used AI to improve clarity, organization, and formatting for my GitHub portfolio. This helped me focus more on the substance of my writing instead of getting stuck on wording or structure. I carefully reviewed all AI suggestions to make sure the final essay still sounded like me and reflected my own experiences.

### 5. Final Project

During the final project, AI was most useful for debugging and interpreting error messages. When something broke and the output was unclear, AI helped explain what the error meant and what areas of the code or configuration were worth checking. This reduced frustration and helped me move forward when progress stalled. AI did not design or implement the project for me. Instead, it served as a support tool that helped me resolve technical issues more efficiently.

### 6. Learning a Concept or Tutorial

AI helped me learn concepts related to ESLint rules and coding standards more effectively. When I did not understand why a rule existed or why something was considered bad practice, AI explained the reasoning behind it in simpler terms. This made the standards feel more logical and less arbitrary. As a result, I became better at applying rules consistently instead of blindly fixing warnings. Over time, this improved my overall understanding of clean and maintainable code.

### 7. Answering a Question in Class or Discord

Sometimes I used AI privately to double-check my understanding before answering questions in class or on Discord. This helped ensure that I was not spreading incorrect information. AI acted as a quick verification tool when I understood the concept but was unsure about specific details. This increased my confidence when participating in discussions. I was careful not to copy AI responses directly and made sure my answers reflected my own understanding.

### 8. Asking or Answering a Smart Question

AI helped me turn vague confusion into clearer, more detailed questions. By rephrasing what I was stuck on and adding context about what I had already tried, AI helped me ask better questions. This usually resulted in faster and more helpful responses from classmates or instructors. Over time, this improved my ability to communicate technical problems more clearly on my own. The main tradeoff was making sure I did not rely on AI every time I needed to ask a question.

### 9. Coding Examples

When I needed a quick reminder of syntax or structure, I sometimes used AI for small coding examples. These examples helped refresh my memory without requiring me to search through documentation for simple use cases. This was especially helpful when switching between different tools or frameworks. I treated these examples as references rather than final solutions. I always modified them to fit my own code and the expectations of the course.

### 10. Explaining Code

AI was useful for explaining code, especially when revisiting older files or unfamiliar patterns. Having a step-by-step explanation helped me understand what the code was doing and why it behaved a certain way. This made it easier to debug or extend functionality later. AI explanations also helped reinforce concepts I had learned earlier in the course. I still verified explanations by checking actual behavior to avoid misunderstandings.

### 11. Writing Code

I avoided directly copying large chunks of AI-generated code. When I looked at examples, I rewrote them myself to ensure I understood how they worked. This helped prevent AI from becoming a crutch while still allowing me to learn from examples. Writing the code myself reinforced problem-solving skills and logic. AI served as a reference point rather than a replacement for thinking.

### 12. Documenting Code

AI helped improve my documentation by suggesting clearer descriptions for functions and components. This made my code easier to understand for others and for my future self. Documentation is an important part of software engineering, and AI helped speed up that process. I always verified that the documentation accurately matched the behavior of the code. Incorrect documentation would be worse than no documentation at all.

### 13. Quality Assurance

One of the most useful applications of AI in ICS 314 was quality assurance. AI helped explain ESLint warnings and suggest fixes, which made it easier to recognize recurring mistakes. Over time, this helped me internalize better coding habits and write cleaner code. AI also helped identify small issues quickly, saving time during debugging. I learned to be careful that suggested fixes did not unintentionally change behavior.

### 14. Other Uses in ICS 314

AI also helped with planning and organization. Breaking large assignments into smaller steps made projects feel more manageable. This reduced stress during weeks with multiple deadlines. Using AI for planning did not remove the need for effort, but it helped me approach tasks more systematically. This made it easier to stay organized and keep steady progress throughout the course.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

Using AI in ICS 314 helped me learn more efficiently when used intentionally. It reinforced concepts like coding standards and structured debugging while reducing time spent stuck on errors. At the same time, I learned that overreliance on AI can limit growth if I skip the thinking process. The most effective approach was attempting problems independently first and using AI only when genuinely needed.

## IV. Practical Applications Outside ICS 314

Outside of ICS 314, I have used AI for debugging in other courses, understanding documentation, and improving resumes. These experiences showed that AI fits naturally into real-world software workflows when used responsibly. In professional settings, AI can save time and improve clarity, but only if its output is verified.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities

The biggest challenge with AI was accuracy. AI sometimes produced confident but incorrect suggestions, which required careful verification. This challenge also created an opportunity to practice critical evaluation. Learning to question and validate AI output is an important skill in software engineering.

## VI. Comparative Analysis

Traditional teaching methods in ICS 314 emphasized discipline and repetition. AI-enhanced learning improved efficiency and accessibility. Combining both approaches resulted in stronger learning outcomes. AI supported learning without replacing effort or responsibility.

## VII. Future Considerations

AI will likely remain part of software engineering education. Teaching students how to use AI responsibly, verify results, and avoid overreliance will become increasingly important. Future courses may need clearer guidance on ethical and effective AI usage.

## VIII. Conclusion

My experience with AI in ICS 314 showed that AI is most effective when used as a support tool rather than a shortcut. It helped me debug errors, understand standards, and stay productive without replacing learning. When combined with discipline and accountability, AI can meaningfully enhance software engineering education.
