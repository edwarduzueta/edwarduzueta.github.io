## I. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence is becoming a normal part of learning in computer science, especially in courses that focus on real tools and workflows. In software engineering, the challenge is not just knowing concepts, but being able to debug errors, follow standards, understand frameworks, and keep moving when something breaks. In ICS 314, AI became part of that process for me, not as a replacement for learning, but as a way to stay productive when I got stuck.

Throughout the course, I used ChatGPT at a moderate level. I did not rely heavily on other AI tools like Bard or GitHub Copilot. Most of my AI usage focused on debugging errors, understanding ESLint and coding standards, checking assumptions, and improving the structure and clarity of my writing. Used this way, AI helped support my learning without doing the work for me.

## II. Personal Experience with AI

Below, I describe how I used AI across different parts of ICS 314, including where it helped and where it had limitations.

### 1. Experience WODs (TypeScript, Coding Standards, UI Design, Next.js)

I used AI during many of the Experience WODs, especially when working with TypeScript, coding standards, and later UI and Next.js WODs. Most of the time, AI was useful when I ran into confusing error messages or strict rules that were not immediately clear.

For example, when TypeScript complained about types or ESLint flagged multiple issues at once, AI helped explain what the errors meant and what the rules were actually enforcing. I still had to apply the fixes myself and make sure they matched the WOD requirements.

Benefit: Faster understanding of errors and standards  
Cost: Risk of relying too quickly on AI instead of slowing down and reasoning through the problem

---

### 2. In-class Practice WODs

For in-class practice WODs, I often used AI after finishing to understand mistakes or improve my approach. This was especially helpful for coding standards and UI-related practice, where small details mattered.

AI helped point out why something was considered bad practice or why a certain structure was preferred, which made the practice WODs more useful as learning tools.

---

### 3. In-class WODs

I used AI much less during in-class WODs. Because of the pace and time pressure, it was usually more effective to rely on my own preparation. In those situations, stopping to consult AI often took more time than it saved.

---

### 4. Essays

For essays, I used AI mainly for outlining and grammar cleanup. I wrote the content myself and then used AI to improve organization, clarity, and formatting for my GitHub portfolio.

This helped me focus more on ideas instead of getting stuck on structure or wording.

---

### 5. Final Project

During the final project, AI was most useful for debugging. When I ran into errors that were difficult to interpret, AI helped explain what the error messages meant and suggested things to check.

AI did not build the project for me, but it helped reduce the time I spent stuck on technical issues.

---

### 6. Learning a Concept or Tutorial

AI was helpful for learning concepts related to ESLint rules and coding standards. When I did not understand why something was flagged as a problem, AI explained the reasoning behind the rule in simpler terms.

This made it easier to apply standards consistently instead of blindly following them.

---

### 7. Answering a Question in Class or Discord

Sometimes I used AI privately to double-check my understanding before answering questions in class or on Discord. This helped me avoid sharing incorrect information and gave me more confidence when responding.

---

### 8. Asking or Answering a Smart Question

AI helped me rephrase vague questions into clearer ones by adding context about what I tried and what went wrong. This usually led to better and faster responses from others.

---

### 9. Coding Examples

When I needed a quick reminder of syntax or structure, I sometimes used AI for small examples. I treated these as references and adapted them to fit my own code and the course requirements.

---

### 10. Explaining Code

AI was useful for explaining code, especially when revisiting older files or unfamiliar patterns. This helped me understand what my code was doing and why it behaved a certain way.

---

### 11. Writing Code

I avoided directly copying large chunks of AI-generated code. When I did look at examples, I rewrote them myself to make sure I understood how they worked and how they fit into my project.

---

### 12. Documenting Code

AI helped improve my documentation by suggesting clearer descriptions for functions and components. This made my code easier to read without changing its behavior.

---

### 13. Quality Assurance

One of the most useful applications of AI in ICS 314 was quality assurance. AI helped explain ESLint warnings and suggest fixes, which helped me learn common mistakes and improve my code quality over time.

---

### 14. Other Uses in ICS 314

AI also helped with planning by breaking larger tasks into smaller steps. This made assignments feel more manageable and helped me stay organized.

---

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

Using AI in ICS 314 helped me learn more efficiently when used intentionally. It made debugging faster and helped reinforce concepts like coding standards. At the same time, I learned that relying too much on AI can limit growth if I skip the thinking process. The most effective approach was trying first and using AI only when I was genuinely stuck.

---

## IV. Practical Applications Outside ICS 314

Outside of ICS 314, I have used AI for debugging in other courses, understanding documentation, and improving resumes. These experiences showed that AI fits naturally into real-world software workflows when used carefully.

---

## V. Challenges and Opportunities

The main challenge with AI was accuracy. Sometimes it gave confident but incorrect suggestions, which required verification. However, this also created an opportunity to practice evaluating information critically, which is an important skill in software engineering.

---

## VI. Comparative Analysis

Traditional teaching methods in ICS 314 emphasized discipline and repetition, while AI-enhanced learning improved efficiency and understanding. Combining both approaches led to the strongest learning outcomes.

---

## VII. Future Considerations

AI will likely continue to be part of software engineering education. Teaching students how to use it responsibly, verify results, and avoid overreliance will be increasingly important.

---

## VIII. Conclusion

My experience with AI in ICS 314 showed that AI is most effective when used as a support tool rather than a shortcut. It helped me debug, understand standards, and stay productive without replacing learning. When paired with discipline and personal responsibility, AI can enhance software engineering education in a meaningful way.
