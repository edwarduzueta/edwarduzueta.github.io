Typescript is a superset of JavaScript designed to make coding safer, more structured, and easier to maintain.

## First Impressions

When I first started learning Typescript, I wasn’t sure what to expect. My background has mainly been in languages like C, C++, and Java, so I am used to stricter rules and stronger typing. JavaScript always felt loose to me. It works fast, but sometimes it feels like you’re walking on thin ice where one small mistake can break everything. Typescript was different. It felt like I could move with the same speed as JavaScript, but now I had guardrails that caught mistakes early. That gave me confidence, especially since I prefer having structure when I’m learning something new.

## How It Compares

Compared to the other languages I have worked with, Typescript feels like a middle ground. C and C++ are strict and unforgiving. If you mess up, the program crashes hard. Java is more balanced but still rigid. JavaScript is on the opposite end: flexible, but sometimes too forgiving, which led to me spending more time debugging than actually building. Typescript gave me the best of both sides. I could still build quickly, but I wasn’t left guessing whether the compiler would let a mistake slip through. Learning it made me realize how much I value that extra layer of reliability and clarity.  

## Athletic Software Engineering

The practice WODs, or Workouts of the Day, were another challenge altogether. I am the kind of person who likes to slow down, check every line, and make sure everything is right. The WODs flipped that on its head. They put me under pressure, forced me to move faster, and made me trust my instincts. At first, it was stressful, but over time I started to see it like Army PT. In the military, you don’t grow by taking it easy. You grow by being pushed past your comfort zone. That is what these WODs felt like: repetition, pressure, and discipline. They trained me to perform under stress, not just when everything is calm.  

## Final Thoughts

Learning Typescript has been more than just learning another programming language. It reminded me that structure and discipline matter, both in code and in life. As I work toward fields like cybersecurity and intelligence, I know precision will matter more than ever. Typescript gives me that precision without slowing me down. Combined with the athletic software engineering style of training, it is teaching me how to stay sharp, adapt under pressure, and grow through challenge. Just like in the Army, the training is not meant to be comfortable. It is meant to make you better. And that is exactly what I have taken away from this experience.
