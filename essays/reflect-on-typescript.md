*Typescript: a superset of JavaScript designed to make coding safer, more structured, and easier to maintain.*

## First Impressions  

Coming into Typescript, I felt both curious and cautious. My background so far has been in languages like C, C++, and Java, so I’m used to structure and strong typing. JavaScript was always a bit of a wild card — flexible, yes, but sometimes too forgiving. Typescript bridges that gap. It brings the discipline of typed languages into the world of JavaScript, and that clicked with me right away. It feels like I can code with the speed of JavaScript but still have guardrails that prevent small mistakes from turning into big problems.

## How It Compares  

Compared to my other programming experiences, Typescript feels like a middle ground. C and C++ demand strict rules and punish mistakes harshly. Java is more forgiving but still very structured. JavaScript, on the other hand, sometimes felt too loose. Typescript gives me that balance — I can experiment like in JavaScript, but the compiler helps me catch errors before I waste time debugging. Learning it made me realize how much I value that extra layer of reliability.  

## Athletic Software Engineering  

The practice WODs (Workouts of the Day) were a whole different challenge. At first, the time pressure was stressful. I’m the type who likes to slow down, double-check, and think through every detail. The WODs forced me to move faster and trust my instincts, which honestly pushed me out of my comfort zone. But after a while, I started to see the value. It’s like PT in the Army — the repetition and pressure build discipline, not just skill. I think this style of learning will help me become more efficient and confident in my coding, even if it’s uncomfortable at times.  

## Final Thoughts  

Typescript has already earned my respect. It’s not just another tool to learn for class — it feels like a language that will actually make me a stronger programmer, especially as I move toward fields like cybersecurity and intelligence, where precision matters. Pairing Typescript with the athletic software engineering approach reminds me that growth often comes through challenge. Just like in the military, the training is tough for a reason. If I keep leaning into the difficulty, I know I’ll come out sharper on the other side.
