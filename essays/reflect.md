When most people hear the phrase *coding standards*, they usually think of debates about tabs versus spaces or where curly braces should go. At first glance, those things don’t seem important because they don’t change how the code runs. But after my first week of using ESLint with VSCode, I realized coding standards are not just about appearance—they shape how readable, maintainable, and even *learnable* code can be.

## Standards as a Shared Language

The hardest part of coding is often not writing new code, but reading existing code—especially if it’s written by someone else. Without a consistent style, trying to understand a program feels like reading a book where every page is written in a different handwriting. Coding standards solve that problem by giving everyone the same “language” to write in. That consistency makes logic easier to follow, reduces confusion, and helps teams collaborate without wasting energy on small details. Even when I come back to my own code, standards make it easier to pick up where I left off.

## ESLint as a Guide

At first, ESLint felt harsh. Red squiggles appeared everywhere, slowing me down and making it feel like I couldn’t write two lines without being corrected. But after fixing enough of the warnings and errors, I started to notice that ESLint wasn’t just nitpicking—it was preventing real mistakes. It caught unused variables, missing `const` declarations, and patterns that could easily turn into bugs. In that sense, ESLint became more of a guide than a critic. The more I worked with it, the more my habits improved, and I began to write cleaner code without even thinking about it.

## Painful but Productive

Fixing every single ESLint issue is definitely painful. Sometimes I just want to run my code and see results, not spend ten minutes adjusting spacing or renaming variables. But I’ve learned that the pain is part of the process. It forces me to slow down, be more disciplined, and develop consistent habits. Over time, that repetition pays off. I make fewer mistakes because I’ve internalized the standards, and my code feels sharper and easier to maintain.

## The Bigger Picture

If I had to choose one software engineering practice to improve code quality, I would side with coding standards. Testing, version control, and design patterns are all important, but none of them can save code that is unreadable. Standards are the foundation that make those other practices effective. They represent respect—for the language, for teammates, and for my future self. Instead of thinking of them as limits, I’ve started to see them as structure that makes me a better programmer.

## Conclusion

My first week with ESLint gave me a much deeper understanding of coding standards. They’re not just cosmetic rules; they’re about discipline, clarity, and preventing errors before they happen. They can feel frustrating at first, but they transform programming into a craft that can be understood and built upon by others. In the end, coding standards aren’t about making code pretty—they’re about making it reliable.
