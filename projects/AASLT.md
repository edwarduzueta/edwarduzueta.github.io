In **2024**, I successfully completed the **U.S. Army Air Assault School**, one of the Army’s most demanding and prestigious qualification courses. Known as the “10 hardest days in the Army,” Air Assault School pushed me to my physical and mental limits.  

The course consisted of three phases:  
- **Combat Assault Phase:** learning aircraft safety, hand and arm signals, and how to properly load and exit helicopters during operations.  
- **Sling Load Phase:** mastering the inspection and rigging of external loads such as vehicles and equipment to be airlifted by helicopters.  
- **Rappelling Phase:** training to rappel from towers and helicopters with precision, control, and confidence. The highlight of this phase was a **90-foot rappel from a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter in flight**, a true test of both skill and courage.  

The culminating event was a **12-mile ruck march** carrying full gear, which had to be completed within three hours. It was a true test of endurance, mental toughness, and determination.  

What I learned most from Air Assault School was the importance of **attention to detail under pressure**. A single mistake during sling load inspections or rappelling operations could have major consequences. The training sharpened my ability to perform with precision even when exhausted, and it reinforced the importance of trust and teamwork in high-stakes environments.  

Earning the **Air Assault Badge** was one of the proudest moments of my military career so far. It represents not only the physical challenge I overcame, but also the confidence and leadership growth that I carry into every mission and task today.
