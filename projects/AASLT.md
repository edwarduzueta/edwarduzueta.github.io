In **2024**, I successfully completed the **U.S. Army Air Assault School**, one of the Army’s most demanding and prestigious qualification courses. Known as the “10 hardest days in the Army,” Air Assault School pushed me to my physical and mental limits. From the very first day, the course tested endurance, attention to detail, and resilience through intense inspections and physical challenges, setting a high standard for every soldier who earned the right to continue.

The training itself was divided into three phases. In the **Combat Assault Phase**, I learned aircraft safety procedures, hand and arm signals, and the proper techniques for loading and exiting helicopters during combat operations. This was followed by the **Sling Load Phase**, where we mastered the inspection and rigging of external loads such as vehicles, fuel pods, and equipment to be airlifted by helicopters. The most demanding part of this phase was the requirement to detect even the smallest deficiencies under strict time limits. Finally, in the **Rappelling Phase**, I trained to rappel from towers and helicopters with precision, control, and confidence. The highlight of this phase—and one of the proudest moments of my military training—was a **90-foot rappel from a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter in flight**, which required complete trust in both my equipment and my training.

The course culminated with a **12-mile ruck march** carrying full combat gear, which had to be completed within three hours. This final test of endurance and discipline brought together everything I had learned in the course—mental toughness, physical conditioning, and the determination to push forward regardless of fatigue. Beyond the technical skills, what I learned most from Air Assault School was the importance of **attention to detail under pressure**. A single mistake during sling load inspections or rappelling operations could have major consequences, so precision and focus were non-negotiable.  

Earning the **Air Assault Badge** was one of the proudest moments of my military career so far. It represents not only the physical and mental challenges I overcame, but also the leadership growth and confidence I gained. The lessons of teamwork, discipline, and precision continue to influence how I approach both my military responsibilities and my academic pursuits in computer science, reinforcing the value of staying sharp and effective under demanding conditions.
